# Commands to facilitate chloropeth-maps for German federal states and districts of the city of Berlin

These Stata ado-files were written for the BA Seminar ["Empirische Sozialforschung"](https://www.sowi.hu-berlin.de/de/lehrbereiche/empisoz/lehreneu/basic/beschreibung) at Humboldt-Universit√§t zu Berlin.

The `germap.ado`-folder contains the ado-file for chloropeth-maps across Germany's federal states.
The `berlinmap.ado`-folder contains the ado-file for chloropeth-maps across Germany's federal states.

Each folder contains:
- a `.docx`-file with a documentation for the installation and usage
- an `.ado`-file that contains the command's syntax
- two `.dta`-files containing the polygon's coordinates and their label-coordinates
- a `.do`-file with some examples to present
- a `.zip`-file of the `.ado`- and `.dta`-files
